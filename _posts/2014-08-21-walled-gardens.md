You want to know who the real innovators are?  I'll give you a hint -- the answer is staring you right in the face.  It's Gillette and Shick - leaders in the quickly escalating men's razor market.

Gillette just released the Fusion Pro-Glide. I kid you not - it is the razor equivalent of the Dyson vaccuum cleaner.  You remember the overpriced vaccuum cleaner that rides on top of a ball?  Gillette just did the same thing with a razor.  Your razor rotates upon a ball with contours and moves never before seen by a razor.  

How did this arms race get started? Shick has the Shick Quattro Titanium Trimmer - how awesome of a name is that?  Not to mention the Gillette Body - a razor built for men's "terrain".  Gillete was founded in 1897 and I'm going to guess razor sales were flat for about a hundred years or so until someone (I'm sure as joke) said "Hey, we should just throw another razor on there". From there the razor wars were on.

So the next time your product looks boring or outdated ask yourself this -- where can I stick just one more blade on there?
