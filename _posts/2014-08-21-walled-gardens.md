You want to know who the real innovators are?  I'll give you a hint -- the answer is staring you right in the face.  It's Gillette and Shick - leaders in the quickly escalating men's razor market.

Gillette just released the Fusion Pro-Glide. I kid you not - it is the razor equivalent of the Dyson vaccuum cleaner.  Your razor rotates upon a ball allowing contours and moves never before seen by a razor.  

I mean Shick has the Shick Quattro Titanium Trimmer - how awesome of a name is that?  Not to mention the Gillette Body - a razor built for men's "terrain".  Gillete has been around since 1897 and I'm guessing razor sales were flat for about a hundred years or so.  Someone I'm sure as joke said "Hey, we should just throw another razor on there" and the razor wars were on.
