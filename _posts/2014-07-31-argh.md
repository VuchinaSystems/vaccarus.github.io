This will be a list of things that make me say 'argghhh'

- If I leave the screen open on my MacBook Pro it goes black.  By going black it has convinced me that it has gone to sleep.  However, I then go to sleep and come back in the morning and the battery is completely dead.  Why?? This never happens on my Dell laptop.

- Comcast calls me every day to offer me an upgrade.  Please leave me alone.  I know your tricks and know as soon as my 6 month deal expires I will have 400 channels of digital cable, three land lines, a Comcast security system and $200 per month bill. Just presume I'm [recording the call](http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/15/5901057/comcast-call-cancel-service-ryan-block).
