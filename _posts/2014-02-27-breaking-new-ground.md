Why is it never as easy as it looks?  All I wanted was a simple blog to post pictures of my dog.  It took quite a bit of work for me to get this poorly written and poorly styled site up.

Having gone the WordPress route in the past I thought I'd try something different.  [Jekyll](https://www.jekyllrb.com) is a "blog-aware" Ruby package that converts plain text into html.  Rather than having a content management system that is dynamically generating pages Jekyll generates content when you publish.  

The result is a static website that should load quick. It also has the benefit that all content can just be written in text files.

Jekyll is lightweight -- so you are in charge of providing your design and CSS.

Since everyone and their mother is using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for their website I figured I better jump on the bandwagon as well.

[Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) combines these two and provides a great how-to on how to get up and running with an example project.  They also cover the details on how to host the site on github.

I've never worked with css or html before so I wasn't even able to hack the basic template. Lucky for us there are a bazillion or so online resources for learning html/css.

I like the format [Code Academy](http://www.codeacademy.com) uses. Its just the right level of interaction to get the basic idea of how things work.

I'm still getting the hang of how where to find and how to tweak the style rules.  

In retrospect, I guess I should have just used Tumblr.
