So you decide to buy a new car and you want all the bells and whistles.  You can get a car that parks itself.  You can get a 470hp Corvette that gets 29mpg. There is no shortage of technology packed into new vehicles. However, if you do decide to get the $2500 navigation upgrade it is basically out of date by the time the car makes it to production. Your car will most likely support the latest iPhone for 6 months before the interface breaks.

Take a look at [Navdy](http://www.navdy.com). Its a heads up disply you stick on your dash projecting on your windshield keeping you to get keep your eyes on the road.  Bluetooth/wifi integration to your phone gives you a host of apps including texts, navigation, etc.  Theres even some gesture recognition (which may or may not be a good idea).  

The development cycle for a new vehicle is in terms of years.  Once the car rolls out the door its unlikely that the firmware will be updated again.  Telsa has the right idea -- over the air firmware updates.  This allows new features to be rolled out while you own the car.  I don't see GM doing this. Maybe the iOS for in-car dashes will get us closer.  Currently, this is in the ripe-for-disruption territory of startups.  I think we'll continue seeing gadgets that make the in car experience more seemless and connected. Even if cars of the future figure this out there is a huge oppurtunity for cars that are a few years old and showing their age.
