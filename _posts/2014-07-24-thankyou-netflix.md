Thank you Netflix... for making it easier to waste even more of my time. 

Netflix will now automatically start the next episode of whatever you're watching when the current episode ends. This saves untold of time spent looking for the remote and clicking play twice.

Two weeks ago Netflix gave the couch potato a hard stop and a choice to make.  The episode finishes and the user must actively find the remote and decide to start another episode.  Do I watch another episode of House OR do I do something useful with my day?

Now Netflix has removed the interia and the decision is made for you. Problem solved for the user and for Netflix. Most of the time this is the correct decision and if its not the user can always turn it off.  Thanks... thanks alot.
